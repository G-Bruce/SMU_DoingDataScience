Background
A registry of student witches and wizards is being altered to be more user-friendly.  The existing dataframe is somewhat difficult to understand.  You are hired to make things more human-readable. They've given you a sample to start.

The CSV consists of the following columns:
Name: Student names all in one observation (both first and last)
Info: The student's House and Year in the school (G is Gryffindor, etc.)
DADA: Exam scores for the Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L.
Potions: Exam scores for the Potions O.W.L.

The Ministry would prefer the following
Name be separated to have first and last names in separate columns.
New columns for House and for Year in school separately.
Create a dataframe that only contains the tidy data.

If you have extra time, feel free to recode House to full names (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin) and exams to their grades (Outstanding, Exceeds Expectations, Acceptable, Poor, Dreadful, Troll.)


cbind(c(G, R, S, H), c("Gryffindor", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin", "Hufflepuff"))

house <- colsplit(unit5$Info,"", names = c("House", "Grade"))
newdf <- cbind(newdf,house)
newdf$House <- sub("G","Gryffindor",newdf$House,fixed = TRUE)
newdf$House <- sub("R","Ravenclaw",newdf$House,fixed = TRUE)
newdf$House <- sub("S","Slytherin",newdf$House,fixed = TRUE)
newdf$House <- sub("H","Hufflepuff",newdf$House,fixed = TRUE)
df <- c()


cbind(c(G, R, S, H), c("Gryffindor", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin", "Hufflepuff"))


df <- data.frame(newdf$FirstName,newdf$LastName,newdf$House,newdf$Grade)
df

newdf$House <- sub("H","Hufflepuff",newdf$House,fixed = TRUE)
